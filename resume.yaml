    summary: |-
      In this work we ’derived’ the famous Pythagorean theorem from the measurements of the sides of right-angled triangles with machine learning. In classical Euclidean geometry, this result is proved with rigorous geometrical argument but we have followed a data driven approach and got the same result without entering a single step in the domain of geometry. 
      We used symbolic regression with Genetic Programming to reach the model.
